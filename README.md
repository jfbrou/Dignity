#### Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [4], [5], [6]

>The data we use to calculate survival rates by age can be obtained from three locations. For the years 1984 to 1998, the authors collected the data from the publicly available PDF files of the [U.S. life tables](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/life_tables.htm). This data file (`lifetables.csv`) is provided in `.csv` format as part of this archive in the `Data/Raw/CDC/` directory of this replication package. For the years 1999 to 2020, we obtained the data [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10.html). For the years 2018 to 2022, we obtained the data [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-expanded.html). Copies of these data files (`Multiple Cause of Death, 1999-2020.txt` and `Multiple Cause of Death, 2018-2022, Single Race.txt`) are provided in `.txt` format as part of this archive in the `Data/Raw/CDC` directory of this replication package. All of this data is in the public domain. To replicate our extracts of the CDC NCHS data, follow these steps:
>1. **Click on the links provided above**:  
>Scroll down and agree to abide by the terms of data use.
>2. **Organize table layout**:

## Computational requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: In general, the specific computer code used to generate the results in the article will be within the repository that also contains this README. However, other computational requirements - shared libraries or code packages, required software, specific computing hardware - may be important, and is always useful, for the goal of replication. Some example text follows. 

> INSTRUCTIONS: We strongly suggest providing setup scripts that install/set up the environment. Sample scripts for [Stata](https://github.com/gslab-econ/template/blob/master/config/config_stata.do),  [R](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/paper-template/blob/master/programs/global-libraries.R), [Julia](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/paper-template/blob/master/programs/packages.jl) are easy to set up and implement. Specific software may have more sophisticated tools: [Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#ensuring-repeatability), [Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/tools_editors.html#Package-Environments).

### Software Requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: List all of the software requirements, up to and including any operating system requirements, for the entire set of code. It is suggested to distribute most dependencies together with the replication package if allowed, in particular if sourced from unversioned code repositories, Github repos, and personal webpages. In all cases, list the version *you* used. All packages should be listed in human-readable form in this README, but should also be included in a setup or install script.

- [X] The replication package contains one or more programs to install all dependencies and set up the necessary directory structure.

- Python 3.6.4
  - `pandas` 0.24.2
  - `numpy` 1.16.4
  - the file "`requirements.txt`" lists these dependencies, please run "`pip install -r requirements.txt`" as the first step. See [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#ensuring-repeatability](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#ensuring-repeatability) for further instructions on creating and using the "`requirements.txt`" file.

### Controlled Randomness

> INSTRUCTIONS: Some estimation code uses random numbers, almost always provided by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). For reproducibility purposes, these should be provided with a deterministic seed, so that the sequence of numbers provided is the same for the original author and any replicators. While this is not always possible, it is a requirement by many journals' policies. The seed should be set once, and not use a time-stamp. If using parallel processing, special care needs to be taken. If using multiple programs in sequence, care must be taken on how to call these programs, ideally from a main program, so that the sequence is not altered. If no PRNG is used, check the other box.

- [X] Random seed is set at line _____ of program ______
- [X] No Pseudo random generator is used in the analysis described here.

### Memory, Runtime, Storage Requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: Memory and compute-time requirements may also be relevant or even critical. Some example text follows. It may be useful to break this out by Table/Figure/section of processing. For instance, some estimation routines might run for weeks, but data prep and creating figures might only take a few minutes. You should also describe how much storage is required in addition to the space visible in the typical repository, for instance, because data will be unzipped, data downloaded, or temporary files written.

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (CURRENT YEAR) desktop machine:

- [ ] <10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-2 hours
- [ ] 2-8 hours
- [ ] 8-24 hours
- [ ] 1-3 days
- [ ] 3-14 days
- [ ] > 14 days

Approximate storage space needed:

- [ ] < 25 MBytes
- [ ] 25 MB - 250 MB
- [ ] 250 MB - 2 GB
- [ ] 2 GB - 25 GB
- [ ] 25 GB - 250 GB
- [ ] > 250 GB

- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described below.

## Description of programs/code

> INSTRUCTIONS: Give a high-level overview of the program files and their purpose. Remove redundant/ obsolete files from the Replication archive.

- Programs in `programs/01_dataprep` will extract and reformat all datasets referenced above. The file `programs/01_dataprep/main.do` will run them all.
- Programs in `programs/02_analysis` generate all tables and figures in the main body of the article. The program `programs/02_analysis/main.do` will run them all. Each program called from `main.do` identifies the table or figure it creates (e.g., `05_table5.do`).  Output files are called appropriate names (`table5.tex`, `figure12.png`) and should be easy to correlate with the manuscript.
- Programs in `programs/03_appendix` will generate all tables and figures  in the online appendix. The program `programs/03_appendix/main-appendix.do` will run them all. 
- Ado files have been stored in `programs/ado` and the `main.do` files set the ADO directories appropriately. 
- The program `programs/00_setup.do` will populate the `programs/ado` directory with updated ado packages, but for purposes of exact reproduction, this is not needed. The file `programs/00_setup.log` identifies the versions as they were last updated.
- The program `programs/config.do` contains parameters used by all programs, including a random seed. Note that the random seed is set once for each of the two sequences (in `02_analysis` and `03_appendix`). If running in any order other than the one outlined below, your results may differ.

### (Optional, but recommended) License for Code

> INSTRUCTIONS: Most journal repositories provide for a default license, but do not impose a specific license. Authors should actively select a license. This should be provided in a LICENSE.txt file, separately from the README, possibly combined with the license for any data provided. Some code may be subject to inherited license requirements, i.e., the original code author may allow for redistribution only if the code is licensed under specific rules - authors should check with their sources. For instance, some code authors require that their article describing the econometrics of the package be cited. Licensing can be complex. Some non-legal guidance may be found [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Licensing_guidance.html).

The code is licensed under a MIT/BSD/GPL [choose one!] license. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.

## Instructions to Replicators

> INSTRUCTIONS: The first two sections ensure that the data and software necessary to conduct the replication have been collected. This section then describes a human-readable instruction to conduct the replication. This may be simple, or may involve many complicated steps. It should be a simple list, no excess prose. Strict linear sequence. If more than 4-5 manual steps, please wrap a main program/Makefile around them, in logical sequences. Examples follow.

- Edit `programs/config.do` to adjust the default path
- Run `programs/00_setup.do` once on a new system to set up the working environment. 
- Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in the prepared subdirectories of `data/`, in the format that you download them in. Do not unzip. Scripts are provided in each directory to download the public-use files. Confidential data files requested as part of your FSRDC project will appear in the `/data` folder. No further action is needed on the replicator's part.
- Run `programs/01_main.do` to run all steps in sequence.

### Details

- `programs/00_setup.do`: will create all output directories, install needed ado packages. 
   - If wishing to update the ado packages used by this archive, change the parameter `update_ado` to `yes`. However, this is not needed to successfully reproduce the manuscript tables. 
- `programs/01_dataprep`:  
   - These programs were last run at various times in 2018. 
   - Order does not matter, all programs can be run in parallel, if needed. 
   - A `programs/01_dataprep/main.do` will run them all in sequence, which should take about 2 hours.
- `programs/02_analysis/main.do`.
   - If running programs individually, note that ORDER IS IMPORTANT. 
   - The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
- `programs/03_appendix/main-appendix.do`. The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
- Figure 1: The figure can be reproduced using the data provided in the folder â2_data/data_mapâ, and ArcGIS Desktop (Version 10.7.1) by following these (manual) instructions:
  - Create a new map document in ArcGIS ArcMap, browse to the folder
â2_data/data_mapâ in the âCatalogâ, with files  "provinceborders.shp", "lakes.shp", and "cities.shp". 
  - Drop the files listed above onto the new map, creating three separate layers. Order them with "lakes" in the top layer and "cities" in the bottom layer.
  - Right-click on the cities file, in properties choose the variable "health"... (more details)

## List of tables and programs


> INSTRUCTIONS: Your programs should clearly identify the tables and figures as they appear in the manuscript, by number. Sometimes, this may be obvious, e.g. a program called "`table1.do`" generates a file called `table1.png`. Sometimes, mnemonics are used, and a mapping is necessary. In all circumstances, provide a list of tables and figures, identifying the program (and possibly the line number) where a figure is created.
>
> NOTE: If the public repository is incomplete, because not all data can be provided, as described in the data section, then the list of tables should clearly indicate which tables, figures, and in-text numbers can be reproduced with the public material provided.

The provided code reproduces:

- [ ] All numbers provided in text in the paper
- [ ] All tables and figures in the paper
- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below.
